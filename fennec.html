        <h2>Concept</h2>

        Fennec is the testers toolbox. The idea it to put all the things a
        tester needs in a single place, and to take advantage of any
        opportunity to enhance them.
        <p>

        Fennec ties together several testing related modules and enhances their
        functionality in ways you don't get when loading them individually.
        Fennec makes testing easier, and more useful. Areas Fennec effects are
        Concurrency, State, Workflow, Tools, and Mocking.
        <p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        The concept for <b>Fennec</b> came about after seeing test frameworks
        not based on Test::Builder that had some desirable capabilities.
        Unfortunately these frameworks also lacked things that made
        Test::Builder desirable.  Initially Fennec was designed as an
        independant framework that had capabilities gathered from many
        different frameworks.
        <p>
        With <b>Fennec 1.000</b> the architecture was rewritten to be based off
        of Test::Builder. Other features were re-written to take advantage of
        Test::Builder and tools built from it. Finally several useful
        components of Fennec were broken up into additional distributions.
        <p>
        <b>Fennec 2.000</b> Introduces some architecture changes that improve
        on design mistakes of 1.000. In addition it fixes bugs, and introduces
        handy new features.

                Note, we see the output for our 3 explicit tests, as well as 2
                additional ones for our implicit tests. The codeblocks that
                surround our tests are tests as well, they fail if the
                codeblock dies or throws an exception.

    <dt id="predictability">Predictability</dt>

        <h2>Predictability and randomness</h2>

        There are 2 conflicting approaches to unit testing:
        <dl>
            <dt>Consistent</dt>
            <dd>
                Every run of the unit test should be the same so that any
                failure or success is reproducable.
            </dd>
            <dt>Randomized</dt>
            <dd>
                The unit test should check for bad interactions by running in a
                random order.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        Both these policies have disadvantages, and if you must pick one I
        recommend 'Consistant'.

        <h3>Fennec gives you both!</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Test blocks run in random order by default</li>
            <li>srand() is always set with the current date</li>
            <li>You can specify the FENNEC_SEED environment variable to set the seed</li>
            <li>You can tell Fennec that a specific file should run in a specific order</li>
        </ul>

        This mean that you can test interactions with a random run order.
        However the 'date as seed' policy means that on a given day the order
        will always be the same. Finally the ability to specify the seed lets
        you reproduce a success or failure from any previous run.
    </dd>

        <h2>Running a subset of tests</h2>

        <div style="border-left: 1px dotted grey; padding-left:5px;">
            Have you ever had to debug a broken test at the very end of a long
            running test file?
        </div>
        <p>

        With Fennec most tests should be grouped together by functionality or
        subsystem. These groups will usually be contained in a 'tests'
        codeblock. With fennec you can specify the 'FENNEC_TEST' environment
        variable. This variable can be set to a test-block name, or a line
        number. The line number can be any line between the start and end of
        the block, this is useful for editor integration.
        <p>

        <h2>Vim Integration</h2>

        Vim integration is easy. The following added to your vimrc lets you
        press F8 to run whatever fennec test block is under your cursor.

        <div class="vim" src="vimrc.vim"></div>

    </dd>

    <dt id="arguments">Arguments</dt>
    <dd>
        <dl class="sub_list">
            <dt>class</dt>
            <dd>
                Used to specify the name of the package your test file is
                validating. When this parameter is specified 3 things are done
                for you: The class is automatically loaded, the $CLASS variable
                is imported and contains the module name, and the class()
                subroutine is defined and returns the name.

                <div class="code" src="classarg.pl"></div>
            </dd>

            <dt>utils</dt>
            <dd>
                Load these modules instead of the default list.

                If you need to specify import arguments for any specific util
                class, you can use the class name as the key with an arrayref
                containing the arguments.

                <div class="code" src="utilsarg.pl"></div>
            </dd>

            <dt>base</dt>
            <dd>
                Load the specified module and make it the base class for your test class.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec base => 'My::Base::Class';
                </script>

                This is much like 'parent' or 'base', but it may save you a
                line. Really it is a pointless feature left in for legacy code
                that actually used it.
            </dd>

            <dt>parallel</dt>
            <dd>
                How many test blocks can be run in parallel.
                <ul>
                    <li>Default is 3</li>
                    <li>Set to 1 to fork for each test, but only run one at a time.</li>
                    <li>Set to 0 to prevent forking.</li>
                    <li>Set to any positive integer.</li>
                </ul>

                Only test blocks are parallelized:

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec::Declare parallel => 3;

                    ok( 1, "This is run in the initial process" );

                    tests block1 { print "This is in a child process" }
                    tests block2 { print "This is in a another child process" }

                    # The block above are not actually run until this gets
                    # called.
                    done_testing();
                </script>
            </dd>

            <dt>collector_class</dt>
            <dd>
                Specify which collector to use. Defaults to a Test::Builder
                based collector that uses temp files to funnel tests from
                child procs to the parent.
                <p>
                You generally won't need to specify this, unless you use a
                test infrastructure that is neither TAP nor Test::Builder
                based.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec collector_class => 'My::Collector';
                </script>
            </dd>

            <dt>runner_class</dt>
            <dd>
                Specify the runner class. You probably don't need this.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec runner_class => 'My::Collector';
                </script>
            </dd>

            <dt>runner_params</dt>
            <dd>
                Lets you specify arguments used when Fennec::Runner is
                initialized.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec(
                        runner_class => 'My::Collector',
                        runner_params => { foo => 'bar' },
                    );
                </script>
            </dd>

            <dt>skip_without</dt>
            <dd>
                Tell Fennec to skip the test file if any of the specified
                modules are missing.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec skip_without => [ 'Optional::Module' ];
                </script>

                This is useful if you have a test for optional functionality
                that only works if another module is installed.
            </dd>

            <dt>test_sort</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>random</li>
                    <li>sorted</li>
                    <li>ordered</li>
                    <li>sub { ... }</li>
                </ul>

                <br />
                Examples:
                <script class="code">
                    # Run in the order in which the blocks were defined
                    use Fennec test_sort => 'ordered';

                    # Run in sorted (ASCII) order
                    use Fennec test_sort => 'sorted';
                </script>

                Code block accepts a list of Test::Workflow::Test objects.

                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec test_sort => sub {
                        my @test_objs = @_;
                        ...
                        return @sorted_objs;
                    };
                </script>
            </dd>

            <dt>with_tests</dt>
            <dd>
                Load these modules that have reusable tests. Reusable tests are tests that are
                common to multiple test files.
                <p>
                Test:
                <script class="code">
                    use Fennec with_tests => [ 'Common::Tests' ];
                    ...
                    done_testing;
                </script>

                Common/Tests.pm:
                <script class="code">
                    package Common::Tests;

    <dt id="subclass">Subclass</dt>
    <dd>
        Sometimes a project may end up using a set of Fennec arguments in
        almost every test. Sometimes there are utility modules everyone on the
        project wants by default. When this happens it can be useful for a
        project to subclass Fennec or Fennec::Declare.

        <script class="code">
            use base 'Fennec::Declare';

            sub defaults {
                my $class = shift;
                my %params = $class->SUPER::defaults;

                # Add a new autoloading utility with import arguments.
